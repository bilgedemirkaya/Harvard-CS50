The challenge ahead of you is to implement the fastest spell checker you can! By “fastest,” though, we’re talking actual “wall-clock,” not asymptotic, time.

In speller.c, we’ve put together a program that’s designed to spell-check a file after loading a dictionary of words from disk into memory. That dictionary, meanwhile, is implemented in a file called dictionary.c. (It could just be implemented in speller.c, but as programs get more complex, it’s often convenient to break them into multiple files.) The prototypes for the functions therein, meanwhile, are defined not in dictionary.c itself but in dictionary.h instead. That way, both speller.c and dictionary.c can #include the file. Unfortunately, we didn’t quite get around to implementing the loading part. Or the checking part. Both (and a bit more) we leave to you! But first, a tour.
