Implement a program that encrypts messages using Caesar’s cipher.
Supposedly, Caesar used to “encrypt” (i.e., conceal in a reversible way) confidential messages by shifting each letter therein by some number of places. For instance, he might write A as B, B as C, C as D, …, and, wrapping around alphabetically, Z as A.
And so, to say HELLO to someone, Caesar might write IFMMP.
Upon receiving such messages from Caesar, recipients would have to “decrypt” them by shifting letters in the opposite direction by the same number of places.
